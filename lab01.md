#  Week 01 lab 6G6Z0024 Applied Cryptography

## The lab session 

* If necessary, we will discuss any remaining material from the lecture.
* Then we can discuss any questions or queries from the lecture.
* Then we can work on the programming and mathematical taks below to consolidate and further our understanding of the topics from the lecture.

## Tasks

We will work with the language Python in a Jupyter notebook since this allows us to easily redit our commands and annotate them nicely. 

* Start the `Anacaonda Navigator` software from the Start menu. 
* Launch a `Jupyter server` and Python 3 notebook.

The [Sympy](https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html) library is a Python library for symbolic mathematics and provides some commands we will make use of. 

```
    import sympy as sp
    
```

Sympy has an inbuilt `gcd` command

```
    sp.gcd(10,8)
```
